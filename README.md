High-performance parallel engine for discovering pseudocycle patterns in Collatz sequences using Tuple-based Transform methodology.

## Mathematical Foundation

### Tuple-Based Transform

The reversible algorithm which transforms Collatz sequence values using the tuple $[p, f(p), m, q]$. A complete Tuple-based Transform calculator is available [here](https://github.com/hhvvjj/tuple-based-transform-calculator). The complete theoretical framework is detailed in this [article](http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15546925)

### Pseudocycle Detection

As the Tuple-based Transform generates sequence values, repetition of the multiplicity parameter $m$ indicates the existence of pseudocycles. These repeated $m$ values, called $m_r$, characterize different pseudocycle patterns. 

This is a high-performance parallel search engine to find $m_r$ pairs. It efficiently detects seudocycles by analyzing the $m$-value repetition and generates detailed JSON output of all discovered $m_r$ pairs in the range of $1$ to $2^{exponent} - 1$. 

### Research Findings

Analysis of the complete range $1$ to $2^{30} - 1$ (1,073,741,823 numbers) reveals a finite set of 42 distinct $m_r$ values:

```
0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 16, 19, 25, 45, 53, 60, 79, 91, 121, 125, 141, 166, 188, 205, 243, 250, 324, 333, 432, 444, 487, 576, 592, 649, 667, 683, 865, 889, 1153, 1214, 1821, 2428, 3643
```

The last distinct $m_r$ value, $3643$, is generated by $n = 7287$ (lower than $2^{13}$). No subsequent values of $n$ produce new $m_r$ patterns within the analyzed range $1$ to $2^{30}$. 

This brute-force approach serves as both a verification tool for theoretical bounds and a discovery mechanism for identifying the complete set of possible $m_r$ values across different ranges of starting values of $n$.

Given the isomorphic character of the Tuple-based Transform, these pseudocycles have direct correspondences in the Collatz sequence domain. The $[n_a, n_b]$ values are:

```
[1, 1], [3, 4], [6, 5], [7, 8], [14, 13], [15, 16], [18, 17], [19, 20], [25, 26], [33, 34], [39, 40], [51, 52], [91, 92], [108, 107], [121, 122], [159, 160], [183, 184], [243, 244], [252, 251], [284, 283], [333, 334], [378, 377], [411, 412], [487, 488], [501, 502], [649, 650], [667, 668], [865, 866], [889, 890], [975, 976], [1153, 1154], [1185, 1186], [1299, 1300], [1335, 1336], [1368, 1367], [1731, 1732], [1779, 1780], [2307, 2308], [2430, 2429], [3643, 3644], [4857, 4858], [7287, 7288]
```
